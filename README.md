Welcome to the "I AM DEVREL" static site repository, a minimalist [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) web project designed to illuminate a not-so-shocking truth with a tad of dry humor: DevRel is the discipline, not a job title. Think of it as a lightbulb moment, only it's a website and the lightbulb is an emoji. ðŸ’¡

This website serves as a gentle, yet firm reminder that DevRel encompasses a variety of roles - each with its unique flavor.
